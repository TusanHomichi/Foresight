What's new

In addition to a new toolchain, Foresight Xfce Edition 2.0 alpha1 features:

PackageKit

With the 2.0 release of Foresight, the Foresight System Manager has been officially replaced with PackageKit.  PackageKit aims to be a unified package manager and installer available for many different Linux distributions, and Foresight is proud to be the first distribution to ship with PackageKit using the Conary backend. PackageKit is a GUI tool for managing software packages and updates for your computer, including installing, removing or searching for new software.

After a default installation, PackageKit is installed and running on your system.  PackageKit is configured to check for updates once a day, and you will be prompted to install them by clicking on the PackageKit icon on your panel.

To manually search, add or remove software, click on System -> Administration -> Add / Remove Software.

Additional documentation on using PackageKit can be found on the Foresight Linux Wiki at https://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/

Syslinux

Syslinux has been added as the default bootloader during installation.  Syslinux is under active development, and Foresight is proud to be the first distribution shipping with Syslinux.  After installation and during boot-up, Syslinux will appear as Extlinux at the bootloader screen.  GRUB is still an option during installation.


Major updates and bug fixes since Beta 1

* PackageKit has been updated to 0.1.9 released 3/5/08.  This PackageKit update includes bug fixes as well as an improved systems update interface.

* Proprietary codecs have been removed.  Users will be prompted to install them automatically the first time they try to use them.

* Transmission, a Bittorrent client, has been added to the default installation and has been updated to the latest release, 1.06.  (FL-856)

Current Issues

* The latest ATI drivers need to be packaged.  (FL-844)

* Xfce4-terminal doesn't work on virtual machines such as kvm, qemu or virtualbox. Work around is to change to xterm with "Preferred Applications"

* Unpinning and uninstalling an older kernel when you have multiple kernels may cause Syslinux to not boot.  (FL-864)

Packages Not Included

* OpenOffice.org is not included by default. We ship Abiword and Gnumeric by default.
