# This file is a template for use by /etc/init.d/distro-release to write out
# your /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net files. Any line beginning with a # is a
# comment, # in other places are literal. Any of the escapes found in issue(5)
# will work in this as well.
#
# Additional available macros:
#   <APPLIANCE_NAME>: The plaintext name of your appliance, as defined in
#                     /etc/sysconfig/appliance. If that file is empty or does
#                     not exist, a generic replacement will be used.
