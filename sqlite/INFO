Library that implements an embeddable SQL database engine

%%% description %%%
SQLite is a C library that implements an SQL database engine. A large
subset of SQL92 is supported. A complete database is stored in a
single disk file. The API is designed for convenience and ease of use.
Applications that link against SQLite can enjoy the power and
flexibility of an SQL database without the administrative hassles of
supporting a separate database server.  Version 2 and version 3 binaries
are named to permit each to be installed on a single host

A parser generator

%%% description %-% lemon %%%
Lemon is an LALR(1) parser generator for C or C++. It does the same
job as bison and yacc. But lemon is not another bison or yacc
clone. It uses a different grammar syntax which is designed to reduce
the number of coding errors. Lemon also uses a more sophisticated
parsing engine that is faster than yacc and bison and which is both
reentrant and thread-safe. Furthermore, Lemon implements features
that can be used to eliminate resource leaks, making is suitable for
use in long-running programs such as graphical user interfaces or
embedded controllers.
