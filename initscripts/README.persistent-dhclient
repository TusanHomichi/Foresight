PERSISTENT_DHCLIENT=YES by default now to make software appliances
that are primarily network-accessible more reliable in the face of
transient DHCP server failure. Because PERSISTENT_DHCLIENT=NO
caused appliance to drop IP address forever in case of DHCP server
unavailability during lease renew. You can override default by setting
PERSISTENT_DHCLIENT=NO in /etc/sysconfig/network-interfaces/ifcfg-ethX
(where X stands for number of desired interface).
