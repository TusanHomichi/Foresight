#%PAM-1.0

# Red Hat says this is right for them, as of 7.3:
auth       required	/lib/security/pam_stack.so service=system-auth

# SuSE 9.0 uses this (along with "--with-passwd-helper" of "unix2_chkpwd")
# auth     required       pam_unix2.so	nullok

# This is what we were using before:
# auth       required	/lib/security/pam_pwdb.so shadow nullok
